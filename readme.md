# Ch33nchan-Torch ðŸš€

## Project Overview

The **end goal** of this project is to replicate PyTorch **from scratch**, using only **C++**. Currently, the repository focuses on building the **core foundations** required to handle tensors, perform mathematical operations, and implement neural networks.

### Current Features:
1. **Tensor Creation**: Implementation of multi-dimensional arrays (tensors) with strides for efficient memory representation.
2. **Matrix Multiplication**: Fundamental operations necessary for forward propagation and backpropagation.
3. **Autograd Mechanism**: Automatic differentiation to compute gradients for optimization.
4. **Loss Functions**: Implementation of Mean Squared Error (MSE).
5. **Simple Neural Networks**: Implementation of a feedforward neural network.

## Mathematical Foundations

This project delves into **tensor operations** and **neural network mechanics**, implementing them at the most fundamental level. Below is a deeper dive into the mathematical and technical details.

### Tensors

A **tensor** is a generalization of scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions. In this implementation:

- **0D Tensor**: Scalar (e.g., 3.0)
- **1D Tensor**: Vector (e.g., [1.0, 2.0, 3.0])
- **2D Tensor**: Matrix (e.g., [[1, 2], [3, 4]])
- **nD Tensor**: Multi-dimensional array

**Stride Mechanism:** Strides are used to map multidimensional tensor indices to a flat array in memory.

For example:
- A tensor of shape `(2, 3)` with strides `[3, 1]` means the value at `(i, j)` maps to `i * 3 + j` in memory.

### Code Example: Tensor Creation

```cpp
Tensor tensor({2, 3}, {1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0}); // A 2x3 tensor
tensor.print();  // Outputs the tensor in matrix format

Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication is the core operation of many machine learning algorithms, including neural networks.

Mathematical Definition:
Given two matrices 
A
 and 
B
:

C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^n A_{ik} \cdot B_{kj}
Dimensions: If 
A
 is 
m \times n
 and 
B
 is 
n \times p
, then 
C
 will be 
m \times p
.

Code Example: Matrix Multiplication
Matrix multiplication is implemented in mat_mul.cpp. Here's the simplified logic:

cpp
for (size_t i = 0; i < A_rows; ++i) {
    for (size_t j = 0; j < B_cols; ++j) {
        float sum = 0.0;
        for (size_t k = 0; k < A_cols; ++k) {
            sum += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
        }
        C[i][j] = sum;
    }
}

Example:
Input matrices:

A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}, \quad
B = \begin{bmatrix} 5 & 6 \\ 7 & 8 \end{bmatrix}
Output:

C = A \cdot B = \begin{bmatrix} 19 & 22 \\ 43 & 50 \end{bmatrix}
Autograd
Autograd is the mechanism for computing gradients automatically. This is crucial for backpropagation in neural networks.

Gradient Computation
If 
y = f(x)
, the gradient 
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
 is computed using the chain rule:

\frac{\partial L}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial y} \cdot \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
Backward Pass
Gradients are propagated backward through the computation graph.

Example:
For 
z = x \cdot y
, where 
x = 2, y = 3
:

\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = y, \quad \frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = x
Code Snippet:

cpp
float grad_x = y;  // Partial derivative w.r.t x
float grad_y = x;  // Partial derivative w.r.t y

Loss Function
The Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss is defined as:

\text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (y_{\text{pred}}^{(i)} - y_{\text{true}}^{(i)})^2
This is implemented in loss_func.cpp.

Code Example:

cpp
float mse = 0.0;
for (size_t i = 0; i < y_pred.size(); ++i) {
    mse += std::pow(y_pred[i] - y_true[i], 2);
}
mse /= y_pred.size();

Neural Network
The neural network is implemented as a feedforward network with one hidden layer.

Forward Propagation
Multiply inputs with weights.
Add biases.
Apply an activation function (ReLU).

Mathematical Representation:

y = \text{ReLU}(X \cdot W + b)
Backpropagation
Gradients are calculated using the chain rule. The weights and biases are updated using gradient descent:

W_{\text{new}} = W_{\text{old}} - \eta \cdot \frac{\partial L}{\partial W}
where 
\eta
 is the learning rate.

Code Example:

cpp
// Forward Pass
Tensor hidden = relu(matmul(input, weights_hidden) + bias_hidden);
Tensor output = matmul(hidden, weights_output) + bias_output;

// Backward Pass
Tensor grad_output = output - target;
weights_output -= learning_rate * matmul(hidden.T(), grad_output);
